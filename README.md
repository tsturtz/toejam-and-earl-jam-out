## Toejam and Earl Jam Out - *Browser Edition!*
### Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è, sprites & CSS keyframes, React hooks, and 'any' riddled Typescript ü§¶‚Äç

---

Toejam and Earl is one of my all-time favorite games and I always loved the absurdity especially in *Jam Out* which is why I was inspired to make this. **Obviously HUGE thanks to Johnson Voorsanger Productions and SEGA for making Toejam and Earl such an awesome game!** And thanks to sprite creators, *DrKelexo*, *Ryan914*, and *Evil_Kefka*.
