Toejam and Earl is one of my all-time favorite games and I always loved the absurdity especially in *Jam Out* which is why I was inspired to make this. **Obviously HUGE thanks to Johnson Voorsanger Productions and SEGA for making Toejam and Earl such an awesome game!** And thanks to sprite creators, *DrKelexo*, *Ryan914*, and *Evil_Kefka*.
